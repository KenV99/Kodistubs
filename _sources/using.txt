Using Kodistubs
###############

Writing Code
============

The main purpose of Kodistubs is to help you to write Kodi addon code in various
:abbr:`IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)`
by providing code completion, quick help based on Kodistubs docstrings,
and code inspection (linting) in IDEs that provide this feature.

Below are the instructions for using Kodistubs in popular Python IDEs.

PyCharm
-------

To add Kodistubs to current project open :menuselection:`Settings --> Project --> Project Structure`,
click :guilabel:`+Â Add Content Root` and select a folder where Kodistubs :file:`.py` files are located.

    **Adding Kodistubs to the current project in PyCharm**

After that you'll get code completion and quick help for Kodi Python API functions/classes/methods.

.. note:: PyCharm quick help partially supports **reStructuredText** formatting.

Eclipse + PyDev
---------------

In PyDev right-click the project's name, select
:menuselection:`Properties --> PyDev - PYTHONPATH --> External Libraries`,
click :guilabel:`Add source folder` and select a folder where Kodistubs :file:`.py` files are located.

    **Adding Kodistubs to the current project in PyDev**

After that you'll get code completion and quick help for Kodi Python API functions/classes/methods.

Python Tools for Visual Studio
------------------------------

In :guilabel:`Solution Explorer` right-click :guilabel:`Search Paths`,
in a context menu select :guilabel:`Add Folder To Search Path...`,
and then select a folder where Kodistubs :file:`.py` files are located.

    **Adding Kodistubs to the current project in PTVS**

After that you'll get code completion and quick help for Kodi Python API functions/classes/methods.

Testing Code
============

You can use Kodistubs in combination with some mocking library, e.g. `mock`_,
to write unit tests for your addon code.

Documenting Code
================

Currently `Sphinx`_ is *de facto* the standard tool for documenting Python code. But for generating
documentation from docstrings it requires your modules to be importable without any side-effects
(i.e. exceptions). If you want to document your addon with Sphinx, add Kodi stubs folder to
:data:`sys.path` of :file:`conf.py` file in your Sphinx project and in most cases your addon modules will be
imported without issues. Just don't forget to protect your module-level exetutable code with
``if __name__ == '__main__'`` condition.

Also the root path of this documentation (without :file:`index.html`) can be used as a reference point
for **intersphinx**. For example::

    intersphinx_mapping = {
        'https://docs.python.org/2.7': None,
        'http://romanvm.github.io/Kodistubs': None,
    }

This will enable cross-references to Kodi Python API objects in your Sphinx-generated documentation.
