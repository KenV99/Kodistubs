Then you will be able to \"import\" the modules as you normally would\r\nin Python.\r\n\r\nE.g. in [PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) go to **File** > **Settings** > **Project xxx** >\r\n**Project Structure**, click **+ Add Content Root** and select a folder with **xbmcstubs** files.\r\nThen you will get auto-completion, quick help and code inspection for Kodi Python API modules.\r\n\r\n**Warning**: Kodistubs are literally stubs and do not include any useful code,\r\nso don't try to run your program outside Kodi unless you add some testing code into Kodistubs\r\nor use some mocking library to mock Kodi Pyhton API.\r\n\r\n[Auto-generated Kodi Python API documentation from Kodistubs docstrings](http://romanvm.github.io/Kodistubs/docs/).\r\n\r\n[Discussion topic on Kodi forum](http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=173780).\r\n\r\nLicense: [GPL v.3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
