{"name":"Xbmcstubs","tagline":"Stub python classes for script and adon development","body":"XBMC Stubs\r\n==========\r\n\r\nThese files can help you to develop a script or an addon for [Kodi (XBMC)](http://kodi.tv/) Media Center.\r\nUse them in your favorite IDE to enable autocompletion of function, class and method names and access docstrings\r\nfor each function, class and method.\r\n\r\nTypically, a Python IDE (Integrated Development Environment) allows you add a \"source directory\" containing\r\nthe xbmcstubs files to your development project. Then you will be able to \"import\" the modules as you normally would\r\nin Python.\r\n\r\nE.g. in [PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) go to **File** > **Settings** > **Project xxx** >\r\n**Project Structure**, click **+ Add Content Root** and select a folder with **xbmcstubs** files.\r\nThen you will get auto-completion, quick help and code inspection for Kodi Python API modules.\r\n\r\n**Warning**: xbmcstubs are literally stubs and do not include any useful code,\r\nso don't try to run your program outside Kodi unless you add some testing code into xbmcstubs\r\nor use some mocking library to mock Kodi Pyhton API.\r\n\r\n[Auto-generated Kodi Python API documentation from xbmcstubs docstrings](http://romanvm.github.io/kodistubs/docs).\r\n\r\n[Discussion topic on Kodi forum](http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=173780).\r\n\r\nLicense: [GPL v.3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
